- ### HEY YOU THE SHIT GIRL

  *2010-07-15*

  hey you the shit girl! what i'd like to tell you, is -- that you've given me a lot, and i thank you so much, indeed.

  your casual and lovely behaviors either in the reality or on the internet, your sweet and sometimes shy smiles, and particularly your big charming eyes full of wondering... all were well attracting me. so i came over to you abruptly and wanted a talk, and unexpectedly was treated warmly, though it was after a sense of uncertainty. i gained some happiness, and even once nearly got lost in it.

  however, i get to realize, that i should recall my old dream, which needs my struggle; and as well care about your own life, which i really should not disturb, at least at this time... so i'll stop. i'll never rob you of anything more, and i'll bring you your usual life back...

  now, i have to set out with my dream around me, struggling. that's wonderful, isn't that? and i think, in the future, if the god allowed, i'd come back to find you again, with something in return for you... for all that you've given me...

- Just waiting for me, Africa!! I've been full of energy!!

- unexpectedly find its Africa that well attracts me
